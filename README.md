## Program Structure

The program structure is organized as follows:

- `src`: Contains the application source code.
  - `apis`: Contains API files for interacting with the backend server or external APIs.
  - `components`: Contains reusable components used throughout the application.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the application.

Here's a brief description of each folder:

- `apis`: This folder contains API files responsible for making HTTP requests to the backend server or external APIs. You can find files like `videoAPI.js` or `searchAPI.js` in this folder. These files handle the logic for fetching data from the server or API endpoints.

- `components`: This folder contains reusable components that are used to build the user interface. Examples of components could be `VideoPlayer.js`, `VideoList.js`, or `SearchBar.js`. These components are responsible for rendering specific parts of the UI and handling user interactions.

- `index.js`: This file serves as the entry point of the application. It renders the root component and sets up any necessary configurations or providers.
